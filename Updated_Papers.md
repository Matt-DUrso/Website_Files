Hello! My JMP, _Firm Debt Relief in Financial Downturn_, will remain updated here until the end of August.

All other files (and a copy of my JMP) have been moved to git hub pages, which makes the viewing/downloading process easier. Please access them from my website: https://sites.google.com/view/mattdurso/research

Thank you!
